I will show you how to link to Facebook from Nekometrics, and how to create a widget with the PAGE LIKES.

Login is at the top right (the user icon).
[Test credentials should be provided separately through secure channels]

- After login, click on "My Dashboard" or "Get Started".
- Click on the Add button at the top right, and add Data Source.
- Click on Facebook, and get through the process you are probably very familiar with :)
- Click on the Add button again, choose Widget, and you will notice "Page Likes". Pick it.
- Click on the Settings button in that widget, link it to the Data Source and pick your page.
- A call to Insights is made, with the number of Page Likes over time.
